yargine is a huge work in progress game engine built in pure c, using binaryen, readline and native posix libs.

# build?
for now, most compatability goes on unix-like systems, however, windows (and maybe macos) compatability is in the works.

requirements:
	- readline (should be preinstalled on modern distros)
	- [binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/releases/)

for linux, just run `./build` and it'll automatically build for you and launch yargine!

# roadmap?
	- base project render screen
	- yargL
	- yargine projects on the web/wasm (with binaryen)
	- yargine projects on [castle](https://castle.xyz)
	- yargine projects on native linux/windows (with sdl?)
